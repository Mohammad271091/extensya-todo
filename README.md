# Todo App

In this project, I made a simplified laravel To-do application that has many features to demonstrate, such as: 
- Public & Private Real-time notifications (Websockets) using Laravel Pusher and Echo
- Restful API using Laravel Sanctum
- Caching and Observer
- Middleware
- Login/registration system using Laravel Auth scaffolding
- Frontend compilation using vite
- Administrative features (on tasks)
- CRUD operations
